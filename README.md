# Waste Management System Smart Contract

## Overview

The Waste Management System is a blockchain-based platform designed to incentivize recycling, track waste management, and create a marketplace for upcycled products. By combining smart bin technology, recycling rewards, and a product marketplace, the contract aims to promote sustainable waste management practices.

## Key Features

### Smart Bin Management
- Register and track smart waste bins
- Monitor waste collection
- Record waste type and quantity

### Recycling Rewards
- Incentivize recycling through token rewards
- Track individual recycler balances
- Encourage sustainable behavior

### Upcycled Product Marketplace
- List recycled/upcycled products
- Enable direct product sales
- Create economic value from waste

## Core Components

### Smart Bins
- Unique identification
- Waste type classification
- Quantity tracking
- Accuracy measurement

### Recycling Rewards
- Balance tracking
- Reward distribution
- Token-based incentive system

### Product Marketplace
- Product listing
- Peer-to-peer sales
- Material-based categorization

## Main Functions

### Smart Bin Operations
- `register-smart-bin`: Create new smart bin
- `update-smart-bin`: Update bin data
- `get-smart-bin`: Retrieve bin details

### Recycling Rewards
- `reward-recycler`: Distribute recycling rewards
- `get-balance`: Check account balance

### Marketplace
- `list-product`: List new upcycled product
- `buy-product`: Purchase recycled products

## Workflow Example

```clarity
;; Register a smart bin for plastic waste
(register-smart-bin "plastic")

;; Update bin data
(update-smart-bin bin-id u100 u95)

;; Reward a recycler
(reward-recycler recycler-address u10)

;; List an upcycled product
(list-product "Recycled Plastic Bag" u25 "plastic")

;; Buy a product
(buy-product product-id)
```

## Error Handling

- `err-owner-only` (u100): Owner-restricted actions
- `err-not-found` (u101): Resource not found
- `err-unauthorized` (u102): Unauthorized transaction

## Security Measures

- Owner-only administrative functions
- Balance verification
- Strict transfer mechanisms
- Comprehensive error checking

## Potential Improvements

- Implement multi-tier rewards
- Add waste type verification
- Create reputation system
- Develop more complex marketplace rules

## Deployment Considerations

- Configure initial contract owner
- Set up initial reward mechanisms
- Establish marketplace guidelines
- Thorough testing on testnet
